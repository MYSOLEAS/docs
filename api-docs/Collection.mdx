##  Collection (PayIn)

You can request a payment from a customer.

Funds will be moved from the customer‚Äôs **mobile money wallet** to your [**SoleasPay account**](https://soleaspay.com).

This operation **must be explicitly authorized by the customer**, who will enter their **PIN code** on their mobile phone.

The operation may take anywhere from a few seconds up to a few minutes to complete.

<Note>
  Please follow the guidelines in the Implementation section of our API docs to ensure a reliable implementation.
</Note>

## üîÅ Collection Flow

1. You send a **payment request** to SoleasPay.
2. SoleasPay forwards the request to the **Mobile Money Operator (MMO)** you specify.
3. SoleasPay respond you witch a **Processing** status
4. The MMO sends a **payment authorization prompt** to the customer's phone.
5. The customer enters their **PIN** to approve the transaction.
6. The MMO returns a **success or failure** status to SoleasPay.
7. SoleasPay notifies you via:
   - A **callback** to your configured URL (if set), or
   - You can **poll the Check Status endpoint (verification status)** manually.

---

## üîî Callback Notification

If you‚Äôve configured a **callback URL**, SoleasPay will automatically notify your system of the transaction result using a **Check Status Callback**.

> If no callback is configured, you can still track the request manually using the `Check Status Status` API endpoint.

## üìå Payment Status Lifecycle

Once your payement request is accepted for processing, it can go through the following statuses:

| Status       | Description                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PROCESSING` | The payout request has been accepted by SoleasPay for processing. |
| `SUCCESS`    | The payout was successful. ‚úÖ **Final State**                      |
| `FAILLURE`   | The payout failed. ‚ùå **Final State**                              |
