##  Disbursement (PayOut)

You can disburse funds from your **SoleasPay account** to a **customer‚Äôs mobile money wallet**.

‚úÖ This operation **does not require customer PIN authorization** and is usually processed within **seconds**.

---

## üîÅ Payout Flow

1. You submit a **payout request** to SoleasPay.
2. SoleasPay forwards the request to the **Mobile Money Operator (MMO)**.
3. The MMO processes the transaction and informs SoleasPay.
4. SoleasPay notifies your backend via:
   - A **callback URL** (if configured), or
   - You can **manually check** the payout status using the `Check Payout Status` endpoint.

---

## üîî Callback Notification

If you‚Äôve configured a **callback URL**, SoleasPay will notify you of the final transaction status using a **Payout Status Callback**.

> If not, use the **Check Payout Status endpoint** to poll the status.

---

## üìå Payout Status Lifecycle

After your payout request is submitted, it may transition through the following statuses:

| Status      | Description                                                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PROCESSING`  | The payout request has been accepted by SoleasPay for processing.              |
| `SUCCESS` | The payout was successful. ‚úÖ **Final State**                                 |
| `FAILLURE`    | The payout failed. ‚ùå **Final State**                                          |

## üì¶ Enqueued Payouts

When an **MMO is temporarily unavailable or experiencing issues**, payouts may not be processed immediately.

In these cases:

- The payout is still **accepted by SoleasPay**, but marked as `PROCESSING`.
- The request is **automatically processed later** when the MMO is back online.

### üõë Cancelling Enqueued Payouts

You can cancel an enqueued payout if it hasn't yet been submitted:

- Use the `Cancel Enqueued Payout` API endpoint.
- Or cancel directly from the **SoleasPay Dashboard**.

---

## üì° MMO Availability

Our Payment Operations team monitors MMO availability **24/7**. You can:

- View the **real-time status** on the [SoleasPay Status Page](https://soleaspay.com)
- Access MMO stability programmatically via the **Availability Endpoint**

> Use this to avoid initiating payouts during MMO downtime.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Tip

Ensure your integration:
- Handles all **status transitions** appropriately.
- Supports **callback or polling** to track payout status.
- Implements retry or cancellation logic for `ENQUEUED` payouts.
