When transitioning from sandbox to **production**, ensure your integration is updated with the following changes:

## Key Differences Between Environments
There are two authentifications types in SoleasPay environment
| Parameter           | Sandbox                        | Production                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Base URL**        | https://sandbox.soleaspay.com  | https://soleaspay.com           |
| **Token**           | Sandbox Bearer Token           | Production Bearer Token         |
| **MMO Environment** | Simulated Transactions         | Live Mobile Wallet Transactions |

## 🔐 IP Whitelisting (Optional)

If your production system uses **IP whitelisting**, don’t forget to whitelist SoleasPay’s callback IPs, or **your server won’t receive status updates** for transactions.


# Go-Live Testing (Pre-Launch Checklist)

Before releasing to customers, perform a **live transaction test** with each MMO you plan to support.

We recommend toggling a **feature flag** (e.g. `USE_SOLEASPAY_LIVE = true`) in your code for switching to live tests without affecting all traffic.

## 📋 What You'll Need:

1. 📱 A **real phone number** subscribed to the desired MMO.
2. 💳 An **active mobile money wallet** on that number.
3. 💰 **Sufficient funds** in that wallet.
4. 🔐 Be ready to **enter the wallet PIN** within **1–60 seconds** of initiating a transaction.

## ✅ Why Go-Live Testing Is Important

- Ensures your app handles **real-time mobile prompts** (PIN, confirmations).
- Validates that **callbacks** are correctly received and processed.
- Detects any production-specific issues **before** customers do.

## Example Test Flow
To disburse money from your SoleasPay account to a final customer you just need to call this endpoint, 

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  --url https://soleaspay.com/api/action/account/withdraw \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <received token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'operation: <operation>' \
  --header 'service: <service>' \
  -data '{
    "wallet": "677777777",
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "XAF"
    "description": "withdraw reason"
  }'
```
