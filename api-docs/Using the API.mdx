# Using the SoleasPay API

## API Environments

When creating an account with SoleasPay, you will first receive access to our sandbox environment. The sandbox environment is completely isolated from our production environment. You can safely test your integration with SoleasPay without real mobile money wallets and real money involved. Access to your production account will be granted after completing the onboarding on your sandbox account.

The base URL for the SoleasPay Merchant API is different between our sandbox and production environments:

| Environment | Base URL                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Sandbox     | http://sandbox.soleaspay.com                         |
| Production  | [https://soleaspay.com](https://soleaspay.com/home/) |

The specific operation can be called by appending the endpoint to the base URL. Example: `http://sandbox.soleaspay.com`

## Authentication

The SoleasPay Merchant API uses a bearer token for authentication. An authorization header is required for all calls to the SoleasPay Merchant APIs except for MMO Availability.

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  --url http://sandbox.soleaspay.com/api/action/account/withdraw \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>' \

  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'operation: <operation>' \
