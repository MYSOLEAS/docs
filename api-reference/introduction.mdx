## Authentication

SoleasPay API requires authenticated tokens in all request headers.  
Depending on the endpoint prefix, they accept:

- **Bearer Token**: For all endpoints starting with `/api/action`
- **x-api-key**: For all endpoints starting with `/api/agent`

## Rate Limits

The number of requests is limited to **500 requests per hour per IP address**.  
If you need a higher limit, please [contact us](https://soleaspay.com).  
All IPs sending excessive requests will be temporarily blocked.

## Callback

<Note>
  In asynchronous systems, all requests will be processed and the final state
  will be sent to your application through your callback endpoint.

  For security reasons, all our requests must include an `x-private-key` header.
  Its value is the SHA-512 hash of your secret key received after configuring
  your callback endpoint.
</Note>
